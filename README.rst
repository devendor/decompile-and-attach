Details
-------

A rework of the original decompile and attach plugin for IntelliJ IDEA provided by
`Babur`_ for compatibility with current versions of IntelliJ idea.

Decompile and attach decompiles jar packages using Intellij's Fernflower decompiler
and attaches decompiled source jars to your project within intellij java ides.

The decompiled source is included within Search Scopes or can be unpacked and analyzed however you wish.

Select one or more jar files in the project menu. Then right click and select the "Decompile And Attach" action.

Check your event log for warnings. Failure to decompile will log a warning and continue to the next jar.

Don't expect perfection. It's a good decompiler, but can't reproduce original source code.

Changlog
--------

**1.8.4 rferguson 12/03/2018**
* rebuilt for 2018.3

**1.8.2 rferguson 09/22/2018**

* Added java-decompiler plugin dependency to build.gradle plugin.xml.
* BugFix - Prior release would blindly produce empty classes with "{ //compiled content" bodies
  when decompile and attach was used before any other decompile activity that triggered legal
  terms acceptance and related key setting. Plugin now reproduced legal disclaimer from java-decompiler
  when needed and sets acceptance key to fix bug.

* plugin.xml in 1.6 excludes support for 2017.2 releases.
  1.5 allows it but doesn't work change to plugin.xml to allow this
  to install on newer release

  to attach and causing an fault
* An empty directory would pass through to decompile and cause a fault.

  limited context like reflections and packages.
